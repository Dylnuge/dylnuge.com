<h1>About Me</h1>
<div class="section-contents">
  <p>
    I've been messing around with computers in some form or another for as
    long as I remember. I've jumped all around as a developer; I've worked
    on frontend web applications, backend systems, databases,
    infrastructure, APIs, and most buzzwords could probably fit somewhere
    on this site (except "blockchain") but I'll avoid the boring details
    there.
  </p>
  <p>
    I really enjoy understanding how systems come together and interact
    with each other. A good bug can be extremely fun, I love designing
    clean and consistent APIs, and spending the time necessary to ensure
    that my systems are simple and usable. I believe that being capable of
    explaining something to a non-expert is a fun baseline for
    understanding it.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm not an expert in most things, but I'm always trying to learn new
    things. I'm currently working at a company called BlueVoyant on
    processing data related to networking and the Internet. I'm learning a
    lot about the underlying structure of network traffic and might
    prepare a talk or article on it sometime soon.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of work, I enjoy learning about linguistics, energy, and video
    game design. I'm a big fan of adventure, and spend a lot of time
    camping or backpacking—my most recent expedition was along the John
    Muir Trail. I'm also a fan of running and karaoke.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks for stopping by!

<h1>Projects, Articles, and Talks</h1>
<div class="section-contents">
  <h2>Smashing Stacks</h2>
  <p>
    I did a talk for BlueVoyant on the concept of stack smashing and the
    paper by Aleph One. I ran it as an interactive session where
    participants got to smash stacks in the process. The talk recording is
    not publicly available, but check out the slide deck or GitHub
    repository which contains both the example code and original Keynote
    file.
  </p>
  <ul class="project-links">
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/Dylnuge/stack-smashing">Git Repo</a>
      &mdash;
      The repo for the talk. There are three interactive examples (and
      some hints). Feel free to DM me on Twitter if you're actually trying
      this and get stuck or want to verify a solution.
    </li>

      <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/dylnuge/smashing-the-stack-for-fun-and-profit">
        Slide Deck</a>
      &mdash;
      The slides for the talk. I don't have slide notes which makes them
      less useful as a visual aid, but unfortunately I don't have a public
      recording for the talk either. Again, if you're actually playing
      with this, feel free to DM me; I'd love to clarify things!

  </ul>

  <h2>Articles</h2>
  <p>
    Nonfiction articles I've written about technology and the tech
    industry.
  </p>
  <ul class="project-links">
    <li>
      <a href="https://medium.com/@dylnuge/chernobyl-devops-software-engineering-disaster-management-and-observability-8a50a7ea98d6">
        Chernobyl DevOps: Software Engineering, Disaster Management, and
        Observability</a>
      &mdash;
      A semi-detailed explanation of Chernobyl and some thoughts on what
      lessons we can take from it as software engineers. Probably my most
      technically involved writing, but most of the tech is nuclear
      physics and not software (go figure). It's framed in the context of
      the Chernobyl TV miniseries but doesn't really require watching
      it—though you should!
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://medium.com/@dylnuge/the-devastating-stereotype-of-the-artless-scientist-45c6348489ff">
        The Devastating Stereotype of the Artless Scientist</a>
      &mdash;
      An article I wrote on Medium after The Imitation Game came out,
      less about that film in particular than it is about my frustration
      with the socially incompetent scientist/engineer stereotype that
      pushes people away from scientific fields. This went viral at the
      time, so I kind of hate it now and would love to edit it.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Other Random Things</h2>
  <p>
    None of this stuff is quite complete, but if you're looking to deep
    dive into random stuff I've made public, here it is.
  </p>
  <ul class="project-links">
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/Dylnuge/cryptopals">Cryptopals</a>
      &mdash;
      First two problem sets for the Cryptopals challenges by Matasano.
      I'd eventually like to go back and add more. I did this in Go,
      partially to learn Go at the time.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://twitter.com/dylnuge/status/1072746366697299968">
        Twitter Thread on the Toxicity of "Genius Assholes"</a>
      &mdash;
      It's just a twitter thread, but I'm pretty happy with it. It's about
      an experience I had in college and how it helped me see that
      brandishing skill and intellect as a weapon damages projects. It's
      quick, just go read it.

<h1>Getting in Touch</h1>
<div class="section-contents">
  <p>
    I'm at least pseudo-active on most of the services linked below. If
    there's a dylnuge on a Slack, Discord, or IRC channel you're in, it's
    probably me. I try to reply to personal emails, but I usually ignore
    unsolicited recruiting emails (nothing personal, I promise).
