When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one developer to
dissolve the overmonetized bands which have connected them with their blogging
platform and to assume among the powers of the blogosphere the separate and
equal static website to which the Laws of Twitter and of Twitter's God, Elon
Musk, entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of social media requires
that they should declare the causes which impel them to their separation.

Having no decent respect for the opinions of social media, I decline.

We write because we can, and we assume other people will read it. This is a test
post designed to ensure that various features of my writing work with this new
static site blog I'm setting up.

I'd like to implement:

* ~~Lists and strikethroughs~~
* Pretty CSS (mostly done)
* ~~Code quoting w/ syntax highlighting~~[^2]
* ~~Quotes~~
* ~~Footnotes~~[^1]

[^2]: test
[^1]: I mean, they present a risk of overuse, but they're also a lot of fun. And we can pretend we're reading Dune again for the first time. Or writing like David Foster Wallace. Cause...that's a goal...right?

These would all be fun things to have. I'm currently working with markdown, so
not totally sure how footnotes will work. Something to figure out.

## An Ascent

Language is a complex thing. Imagine, for instance, that you wanted to
understand it. You might listen to it and respond with it, but John Searle might
not like that.

```c
/* Exerpt from Macbeth Act 5, Scene 5, C-lilliquy version */

// Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow
while (TOMORROW && TOMORROW && TOMORROW) {
  // Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
  day += PETTY_PACE;
  recorded_time = day;
  // To the last syllable of recorded time
  if (recorded_time == LAST_SYLLABLE) {
    break;
  }

  // And all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death
  yesterdays[(day * 1/PETTY_PACE)] = (LIGHTED << (DEATH)) | DUSTY;

  // Out, out, brief candle
  int candle = yesterdays[(day * 1/PETTY_PACE)]
  if (candle & BRIEF) {
    candle &= (OUT, OUT);
  }
}
```

## A Crash

There's not much more to say, is there?
