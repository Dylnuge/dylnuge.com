The last two articles I wrote on Medium both got tens of thousands of views
(according to Medium's stats). It felt great to go viral (by some standard), but
I find myself frustrated with Medium's current model and the control I
sacrifice over my content in order to write there. I'm done with Medium now.

Blogs are kind of self-indulgent things. I want the posts I write to reach
people and help people, but at the same time I'm definitely doing this for
myself. I like writing, sharing content, and of course, there's a tinge of
excitement to going viral.  This is going to be one of those self-indulgent
posts: there's probably dozens of "I'm quitting &lt;insert social media platform
here&gt;" stories out there, and this is basically just another one (plus, I
need _something_ to serve as a first post on this blog). Feel free to skip it.

# Goodbye, Medium

There are a lot of reasons I started writing on Medium. It was popular and
trendy. I loved the design, and it let me focus on the content of my post
without having to worry about things like layout and accessibility. It provided
me with a platform that would share my story to others interested in it.

That last element has eroded over time, to the point it's basically non-existent
now. I'm much more worried that writing on Medium limits my potential audience
instead of expanding it. Under their monetization program, if you don't opt in
your article to be monetized, they won't share it with others. It seems to me
like nearly everything they promote on their site directly is now behind a 3
article paywall.

## Medium's Monetization Makes No Sense for Readers

Medium seems to want to monetize the way publishers do, but they seem unwilling
to actually behave like a publisher.

Paywalls are controversial, but they make some sense for an organization like
_The New York Times_. Every article published on the NYT website was reviewed by
NYT editors. Most were written by NYT staff, and those that weren't were written
by collaborators who were directly paid by the _Times_ for their article. Medium
barely vets the articles they receive for publication; a thing I know because I
experimented with their paywall for my _Chernobyl Devops_ article.

According to Medium, that article is a "22 minute read." It's hard for me to say
for sure (it took me about six hours to write, edit, and publish it, so it's
readable in _under_ a few hours, clearly) how accurate that is, but it feels
like it's about right. "22 minute read," however, does not mean "22 minute edit"
or "22 minute review."

This is an article that, especially at the beginning, contains some dense
technical information. It also contains a wide variety of claims in it. I talk
about the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. I talk about how power plants work,
nuclear and otherwise. I talk about the 2003 Northeast Blackout, which isn't
directly related to either of those topics. I reference the contents of a
six-part miniseries on HBO. I mention in passing a separate incident at another
nuclear power plant, the uncontrolled acceleration issues with Toyota vehicles
in the mid 2000s, and an AWS incident at a previous employer of mine.

I have no credentials, either in journalism or nuclear energy. My background is
in data engineering. I've published exactly two other articles on Medium, one of
which reached the top three articles being read on the site when I published it,
but neither of which tackle such a complex topic. In short, I have no reputation
to stand on.

I submitted the article to the Medium paywall on a Saturday evening (US Pacific
Time). Within a couple of hours[^1], I had an email:

> Hi there,
>
> Our curators just read your story, _Chernobyl DevOps: Software Engineering, Disaster Management, and Observability_, that you submitted for review. Based on its quality, they selected it to be recommended to readers interested in Software Engineering and TV across our homepage, app, topic pages, and emails.

I don't know what this review entailed, but it doesn't come close to the
standards of editing that even a local newspaper with a paywall would have. I'm
almost certain it involved no fact-checking, style and voice review[^3], or even a
scan that I followed proper journalism ethical standards[^2].

Any of those methods of review would have almost certainly resulted in _edits_
being requested for my content to be "included." I somewhat doubt, as a first
time submitter to Medium, that my article was just perfect (in fact, I found and
corrected a few minor typos the next day, and there's at least one major thing
I'd like to change about the structure of the article if I were to write it
today).

As far as I can tell, the important hard and fast rules for being accepted are
"don't include your own ads/affiliate links," "don't steal copywritten
material," "don't harass or attack other people" (hey, that's a good one!),
"don't request donations," and "don't write about Medium."

That last one is kind of awkward, though I'm actually glad they wrote it out (I
suspect even if they hadn't that they wouldn't be "curating" any stories that
took a negative stance on Medium).

[^1]: I recall this being about two hours, but unfortunately, I cannot find an exact record of when I published the story to Medium. The email quoted here was sent at 8:15 PM US Pacific Time on the day I published the story.
[^2]: I cite sources for my information including two books and the 1992 INSAG report on the disaster. I use images which I'm legally allowed to use and clearly cite those sources as well. Ensuring my citations exist, I'm allowed to cite them, and that they say what I claim they do is a basic editorial duty. In other words, I'm unsure anyone checked my article wasn't just "Fake News." Medium does claim to do this, but it would take more than a couple hours for a deeply technical story.
[^3]: Medium does publish a [basic set of minimum guidelines and content rules](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006362473-Medium-s-Curation-Guidelines-Everything-Writers-Need-to-Know) for writers, but it do not seem to have explicit style guidelines beyond this, so paywalled articles are all over the place.

## Medium's Monetization Kills Its Platform Value

It seems to me like Medium wants to monetize like a publisher but _be_ a
platform. However, Medium is moving towards only actually recommending articles
that are behind its paywall, eliminating most of its platform value[^4].

When I published [my first viral post](https://medium.com/p/45c6348489ff) on
Medium in 2015, I didn't do any real work to promote it. I legitimately had no
expectation it would be popular. At the time, Medium had a site-wide "top
stories" feature that was listing off the things most read at the time. My story
managed to make it into that list, and then nearly to the top of that list.
According to Medium's stat tracker, 40% of my traffic came from that list or
other internal "recommended stories" type features. Most of my external traffic
was people sharing it on Facebook, Twitter, and GMail.

By contrast, [my second viral
post](https://medium.com/@dylnuge/chernobyl-devops-software-engineering-disaster-management-and-observability-8a50a7ea98d6)
was one that I went through the curation process for, as well as self-marketed
via sharing it in places like Twitter, Reddit, and among friends and colleagues.
I pulled the article from distribution once I realized I didn't want it
paywalled. It was still popular and read.

To be sure, some of that comes from the fact that the links being shared were to
Medium, which made users less suspicious of them. Some of it comes from people
who like reading on Medium and might be turned off by another site. And
it's possible one or more of these sites prioritize Medium links in their own
distribution algorithms[^5].

## Medium Doesn't Feel Right for Most of My Writing

This last point in my rambling is more personal. Both of the articles I've had
do well on Medium were written as in-depth journalism feature pieces (the first
was, essentially, a piece of media criticism, and the second was a feature
article on software engineering practices). These feel _right_ for Medium, in a
lot of ways.

But sometimes I want to write a short article about something deeply technical.
Sometimes, like here, I want to ramble on about why I am doing a thing that
almost no one is very likely to actually care about.

I have figured out how to write Medium articles well, from catchy headlines[^6]
to images that break up the wall-of-text contents to contents that are relevant
to current popular things[^7] to a voicing that makes my article sound like it
might be at home in a long-form periodical like _The Atlantic_ or _Wired_[^9]. I
also write Medium articles _rarely_; it was four years between my two pieces on
the site.

In writing on Medium, I've gained some nice editing tools and pretty formatting.
But I've also lost tools I care about[^8] and lost control over formatting. When
people read my articles, do they really associate it on any level with me? Are
there people who know me personally, read one of my articles, and didn't even
realize it was mine.

Building this blog lets me have a space that is fully mine. The rules belong to
me. The content belongs to me. The character belongs to me. Maybe it won't have
the outreach of Medium, but I suspect short posts about little quirky technical
things will be much more common. This is probably more of an exceptional post
than the rule. And I'm OK with that.

[^6]: Some people might call these "clickbait." I don't think that's entirely fair; the _job_ of a headline in a feature article is to market the article. If the headline invokes curiosity or an emotional response, it's doing its job. I think of "clickbait" as articles that use a headline to mask low-quality content.
[^7]: Both my articles used recent popular media (specifically, television and movies) to frame their point. The Chernobyl article in particular wasn't really _about_ the TV show, but the TV show made Chernobyl popular, so it was my framing device.
[^8]: Like footnotes. Shockingly.
[^9]: My Medium editorial voice is probably more irreverent and comic than either of those publications would accept, but it's still not that far off, and in particular the comedy seems to land well on Medium.

# Hello, Homepage

Okay, so that was a bit _ranty_, and the truth is, Medium has to figure out how
to handle the challenge of monetization, and it's a difficult problem for them.
I don't fault people for writing on Medium, especially if they need to make
money from their writing.

But I've been using Medium as a bit of a shortcut, a way to avoid the challenges
of setting up and formatting my own website and properly advertising the posts
on it (e.g. by sharing them on social media). Truthfully, the idea of having my
own space on the internet that's purely mine really attracts me.

{{<tweet 1069674780826071040>}}

More and more of the web feels corporate to me, and I don't see a particularly
good reason for that. It's easier now than it ever has been before to set up a
personal website. I intentionally built this page in Hugo from scratch, but it
would have been a lot less work to drop in a pre-fabricated Wordpress template
and point it at my domain. Both options are free minus the cost of the domain
(about $10 USD a year from most registries).

The lack of personal content leads to a loss of personalization. More and more,
I find myself _loving_ when a link goes to someone's personal blog, where they
have their own theming and styles. I want to build a site that reflects the web
I want to be on, where not every article feels identical because it's all fed
through the same platform.

This isn't an anti-corporate "platforms are bad" screed (though believe me, I
have those concerns), but a web-positive message. I want to make it easier for
anyone to do what I'm doing. I'm decently comfortable with text editors, command
lines, and web servers; ideally this could be done by people who aren't. But
Medium's audience seems to be skewed pretty strong towards technical people
anyways.

This is an article I'd never put on Medium, and not just because it's critical
of Medium. It's just not a thing that's meant to be read by people who don't
care about me. It assumes a high context of who I am and it's about a decision
I'm making, personally. Those things can go viral (see every other post about
leaving the Bay Area) but they feel like they're usually written for the
edification of the author, and that's OK.

So yeah, maybe no one will follow this heavily, and maybe my average post won't
be as popular, but I'll sure feel more comfortable putting up content that is
less curated and more experimental.
