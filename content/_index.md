## About Me

My name is Dylan Nugent, and I work in software. I've been an engineering
manager for the better part of this year. Before that I spent around five years
working as a software engineer (at various companies, with various seniority, in
various departments, and having various honorifics) in the San Francisco Bay
Area.

More importantly, I enjoy building systems, understanding systems, and writing
about how they work. The blog posts on this site aren't connected by a more
complex theme than "things I want to write about." Usually that's software or
management. Sometimes it's music, running, backpacking, mental health, or video
games.

If you have questions, feel free to reach out—my Twitter DMs are usually open,
and I'm available on Keybase and Signal if you're concerned about privacy. I'm
also a member of a number of tech (and non-tech) Slacks and Discords. Chances
are good if you see a "dylnuge" it's me.

If you're looking to hire, I'm flattered but not actively looking for a job
right now.

Thanks for stopping by!

## Projects, Articles, and Talks
### Smashing Stacks

I did a talk for BlueVoyant on the concept of stack smashing and the paper by
Aleph One. I ran it as an interactive session where participants got to smash
stacks in the process. The talk recording is not publicly available, but check
out the slide deck or GitHub repository which contains both the example code and
original Keynote file.

    &mdash;
    The repo for the talk. There are three interactive examples (and
    some hints). Feel free to DM me on Twitter if you're actually trying
    this and get stuck or want to verify a solution.

      Slide Deck</a>
    &mdash;
    The slides for the talk. I don't have slide notes which makes them
    less useful as a visual aid, but unfortunately I don't have a public
    recording for the talk either. Again, if you're actually playing
    with this, feel free to DM me; I'd love to clarify things!

### Articles

I've written a couple of nonfiction articles in places other than this website.
Here they are.

<ul class="project-links">
  <li>
    <a href="https://medium.com/@dylnuge/chernobyl-devops-software-engineering-disaster-management-and-observability-8a50a7ea98d6">
      Chernobyl DevOps: Software Engineering, Disaster Management, and
      Observability</a>
    &mdash;
    A semi-detailed explanation of Chernobyl and some thoughts on what
    lessons we can take from it as software engineers. Probably my most
    technically involved writing, but most of the tech is nuclear
    physics and not software (go figure). It's framed in the context of
    the Chernobyl TV miniseries but doesn't really require watching
    it—though you should!
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://medium.com/@dylnuge/the-devastating-stereotype-of-the-artless-scientist-45c6348489ff">
      The Devastating Stereotype of the Artless Scientist</a>
    &mdash;
    An article I wrote on Medium after The Imitation Game came out,
    less about that film in particular than it is about my frustration
    with the socially incompetent scientist/engineer stereotype that
    pushes people away from scientific fields. This went viral at the
    time, so I kind of hate it now and would love to edit it.
  </li>
</ul>

### Other Random Things

None of this stuff is quite complete, but if you're looking to deep dive into
random stuff I've made public, here it is.

<ul class="project-links">
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/Dylnuge/cryptopals">Cryptopals</a>
    &mdash;
    First two problem sets for the Cryptopals challenges by Matasano.
    I'd eventually like to go back and add more. I did this in Go,
    partially to learn Go at the time.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/dylnuge/status/1072746366697299968">
      Twitter Thread on the Toxicity of "Genius Assholes"</a>
    &mdash;
    It's just a twitter thread, but I'm pretty happy with it. It's about
    an experience I had in college and how it helped me see that
    brandishing skill and intellect as a weapon damages projects. It's
    quick, just go read it.
