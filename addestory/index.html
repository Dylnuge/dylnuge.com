          It’s my final week at Addepar, and I don’t feel like leaving without
          enshrining some of the many memories you have all given me. Things
          won’t be the same without you all, and I hope every one of you stays
          in touch.

        <p class="slide">
          As such, I've put together this Addestory to capture as much of it as
          I can, highlighting it using musical selections, photos (most of which
          I've shamelessly stolen from other people), and words (most of which
          can be safely ignored).

          My Addepar internship started May 28, 2013, but I moved into the
          Addepalace on the Saturday before. Despite it being my second time
          living in California, I was quickly informed by my new roommate Carter
          that the first time had not counted, as I hadn’t yet eaten In-And-Out.
        </p>
        <p class="slide">
          The rest of the Addepar 2013 intern class moved in over the next
          couple of days. Pretty much all of you know me, Carter, and Damien.
          The other three were Joy, Raymond, and Evan. In spite of (or maybe
          because of) the close living quarters, we all became close friends
          quickly.
        </p>
        <p class="slide">
          I liked playing music in the Addepalace; one night using the
          Addepalace Twitter account Raymond and I had a discussion about the
          song Synthetica, hence its position as the first song in my playlist.

          Before we had any official intern events, Robin and Will Chu invited
          us up to the city to explore. We visited Dolores Park and hung out
          around the Mission, generally having a pretty good time. The other
          four interns there (Evan hadn’t started yet) will remember this as the
          day I lead them to believe that a 2 mile hike to the 22nd street
          Caltrain station would be worthwhile.

          Several things define the 2013 Addepalace (there was only one back
          then). Dylan will probably wake you up by singing in the morning.
          Birds are constantly plotting their attack against the palace. Air
          dusters are for spraying in people’s faces late at night. Gordon.
          Electric razors turn on when you least expect them to. Donuts cannot
          be purchased without donut accessories. The best, though, were Joy’s
          cooking and confectionery experiments.

          We used to visit the Shadow’s pool a lot, and share a lot of music.
          “Summertime,” the second playlist song, is from a playlist I made at
          the Addepalace to share music with everyone else. “National Anthem,”
          however, stole the show from that playlist when Carter danced to it on
          roller skates while holding a bottle of wine.

          A special surprise announced turned out to be ice cream and neither
          Meatloaf or meatloaf, though <em>“I Would Do Anything for Love”</em> still made
          it onto the companion playlist. “An Acoustic Evening with Meatloaf”
          didn’t happen, but we held a protest “concert” anyways. From haikus in
          the bathrooms to our wonderful shirts, I’ll never forget all the
          sometimes silly, sometimes serious, always amazing work our design
          team puts together. This was (clearly) not one of them; I made it on
          my laptop. From the night without meatloaf I’ve selected the overly
          appropriate <em>“All My Friends.”</em>

          Other choice memories from that weekend: trivia Team Humility which to
          this very day will not accept their loss and move on, Eric Tung’s
          amazing puzzle competition, Monterey Aquarium, the ropes instructor
          asking if Addepar was a clothing label, and the Tobin load balancer
          dance.

          This was the first bottle of alcohol I purchased legally in the United
          States. Time was about 1 AM, I officially turned 21 on the Caltrain
          back down from the city. It was a bittersweet moment, since it also
          meant my internship was coming to an end.

          That didn’t mean the summer was over though! For Raymond’s last
          weekend (and most of our penultimate weekends) we went out to Chez TJ.
          The meal was ridiculously expensive but so much fun. Food is pictured
          at actual size.
