          It’s my final week at Addepar, and I don’t feel like leaving without
          enshrining some of the many memories you have all given me. Things
          won’t be the same without you all, and I hope every one of you stays
          in touch.

        <p class="slide">
          As such, I've put together this Addestory to capture as much of it as
          I can, highlighting it using musical selections, photos (most of which
          I've shamelessly stolen from other people), and words (most of which
          can be safely ignored).

          Also, Karthik is probably ashamed of all of you for clicking random
          links.

          My Addepar internship started May 28, 2013, but I moved into the
          Addepalace on the Saturday before. Despite it being my second time
          living in California, I was quickly informed by my new roommate Carter
          that the first time had not counted, as I hadn’t yet eaten In-And-Out.
        </p>
        <p class="slide">
          The rest of the Addepar 2013 intern class moved in over the next
          couple of days. Pretty much all of you know me, Carter, and Damien.
          The other three were Joy, Raymond, and Evan. In spite of (or maybe
          because of) the close living quarters, we all became close friends
          quickly.
        </p>
        <p class="slide">
          I liked playing music in the Addepalace; one night using the
          Addepalace Twitter account Raymond and I had a discussion about the
          song Synthetica, hence its position as the first song in my playlist.
