      <div class="title">Hi, I'm Dylan</div>
      <div class="title-subhead">
        I use the username <span class="console-text">dylnuge</span>
        online. I'm a software engineer living in San Fran&shy;cisco. I love
        playing with computers and diving into systems to under&shy;stand them.
        This is my personal website.

        <p>
          I've been messing around with computers in some form or another for as
          long as I remember. I've jumped all around as a developer; I've worked
          on frontend web applications, backend systems, databases,
          infrastructure, APIs, and most buzzwords could probably fit somewhere
          on this site (except "blockchain") but I'll avoid the boring details
          there.
        </p>
        <p>
          I really enjoy understanding how systems come together and interact
          with each other. A good bug can be extremely fun, I love designing
          clean and consistent APIs, and spending the time necessary to ensure
          that my systems are simple and usable. I believe that being capable of
          explaining something to a non-expert is a fun baseline for
          understanding it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not an expert in most things, but I'm always trying to learn new
          things. I'm currently working at a company called BlueVoyant on
          processing data related to networking and the Internet. I'm learning a
          lot about the underlying structure of network traffic and might
          prepare a talk or article on it sometime soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, I enjoy learning about linguistics, energy, and video
          game design. I'm a big fan of adventure, and spend a lot of time
          camping or backpackingâ€”my most recent expedition was along the John
          Muir Trail. I'm also a fan of running and karaoke.

          I'm not totally sure why you're here, as there's not much content
          right now. I intend to post random work and projects here as they come
          up. In the mean time, I'm glad you chose to stop by!

          I'm at least pseudo-active on most of the services linked below. If
          there's a dylnuge on a Slack, Discord, or IRC channel you're in, it's
          probably me. I try to reply to personal emails, but I usually ignore
          recruiting spam (nothing personal, I promise).
